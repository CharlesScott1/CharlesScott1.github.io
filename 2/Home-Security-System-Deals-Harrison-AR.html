<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>

<h3>Security In The Home Harrison AR 72601</h3>
<p>Nurse calling systems usually consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's bathroom. He can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station if a patient is having difficulty. This is a basic switch that is typically open or normally closed.
