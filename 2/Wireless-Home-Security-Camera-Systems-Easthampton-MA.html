<p>The NVR removes these problems, because it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder prior to buying.</p>

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
