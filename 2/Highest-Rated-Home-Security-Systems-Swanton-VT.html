With the more recent system, you will pay more, but that higher rate comes with a system that is smaller, much faster, and stronger.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
