<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a typical camera image. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve information after the reality, which means that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are large and take up a lot of tape-recording storage space.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
