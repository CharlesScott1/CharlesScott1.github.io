<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store.
