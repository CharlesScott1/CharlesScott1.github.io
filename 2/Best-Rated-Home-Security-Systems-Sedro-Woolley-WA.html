Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
