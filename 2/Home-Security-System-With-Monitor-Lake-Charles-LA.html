<h3>Remote Home Security in Louisiana</h3>
<p>We downloaded each camera's app to an iPhone 7, an iPad, and a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie, when possible. The cameras invested weeks securing our front door, signaling us to good friends, family members, delivery individuals, and even the milkman. Once we got a good enough look at those friendly faces, we slanted the whole collection outward for another 2 weeks to see what kind of outcomes we would get when the cameras faced your home throughout the street, which is roughly 50 feet away.</p>
