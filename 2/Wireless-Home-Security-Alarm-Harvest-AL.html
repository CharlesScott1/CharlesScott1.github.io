<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based upon offered bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

The monitoring center associated with your home security system ought to be informed within seconds of an alarm (and call you not long after to validate the cause).

The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and taped clips, in addition to when we made changes in the settings.</p>

<p>TP-Link's Kasa Web cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of view that might match a few of our top picks. It likewise features 2 days of totally free cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can cram in clips of up to 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips. Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control panel and keypads, different sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. They are the only company of the four mentioned that uses a mix of wired and wireless technology so keep that in mind when deciding.</p>
