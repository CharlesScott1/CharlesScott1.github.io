<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
