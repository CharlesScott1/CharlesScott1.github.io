<p>The loudest of the clever alarm we evaluated, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at warning anybody in your home and those close-by that there's a problem. During testing, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we enjoy that the sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adjusted to account for pets, too. The alarm system is simply one of two we checked that consists of an external siren, and we're amazed that it likewise comes with a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, even more dissuading anybody from trying to break in to your residential or commercial property.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
