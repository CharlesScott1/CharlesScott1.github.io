<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power.</p>
