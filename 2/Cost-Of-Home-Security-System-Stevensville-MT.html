The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also good metal construction.

<p>IP (Web procedure) cameras perform the very same functions as their analog counterparts, but with vastly greater capabilities.

Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I checked, including clever things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.
