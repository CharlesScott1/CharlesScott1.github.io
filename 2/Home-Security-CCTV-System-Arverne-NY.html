<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, because it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
