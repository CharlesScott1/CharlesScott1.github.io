<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
