<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment by doing this to make clients stick with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies implies numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for clients. How did they do it? They put five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software and firmware.
