<p>Blink cameras are compact, consist of totally free storage, and utilize two AA batteries that can last up to two years. Nevertheless, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink doesn't offer you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
