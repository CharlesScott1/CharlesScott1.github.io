<p>Discover how to create, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and lower criminal activity. The Ring Floodlight Web cam integrates 2 essential devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera identifies motion, it turns on its two effective LED beams as well as its sharp 1080p camera, and begins recording.
