<h3>Home Security Alarm System in New Hampshire</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that it's more complicated than it should be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control board and keypads, different sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.
