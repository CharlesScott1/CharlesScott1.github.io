The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
