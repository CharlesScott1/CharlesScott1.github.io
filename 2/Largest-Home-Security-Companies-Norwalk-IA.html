<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later created to resolve the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly picked words) makes pre-shared essential WPA virtually uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

<p>Our burglar alarms may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge an infraction. Once a zone has actually been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
