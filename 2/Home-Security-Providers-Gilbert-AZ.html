We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is created by something with the same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no false signals).

<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
