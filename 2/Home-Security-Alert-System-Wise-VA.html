<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
