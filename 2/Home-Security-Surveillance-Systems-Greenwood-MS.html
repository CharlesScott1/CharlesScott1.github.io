<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against fraud, vandalism, and theft. Recommendation: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should once again react to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating pricey false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically turn off the heating systems. You can instantly make the smart lights turn on to terrify away prospective robbers if the motion sensors are activated.</p>

Certainly not ideal-- but the representative said sorry and shipped her replacement control panel over night.</p>
