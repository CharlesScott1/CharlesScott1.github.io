<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound changes to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being viewed by the authorities - or conscious they may be watched at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "understanding that you are being viewed by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "people may find out to be mindful about the periodicals and books they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people considered to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>
<p>Some of the home security companies profiled in this report consist of ADT, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Innovation, Assa Abloy, Secom, Robert Bosch, United Technologies, Godrej & Boyce, Allegion, Control4, Schneider Electric, Legrand, Comcast, and Vivint.
