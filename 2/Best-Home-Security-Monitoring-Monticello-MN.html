High-quality, tactically placed residential security cameras permit homeowners to watch their homes at all times.

<p>Outdoor Camera - This weatherproof camera provides smooth security video with a combination of difficult wiring and WiFi. It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send voice warnings through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you zoom in on the action. Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to provide on its guarantee of approximately one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings. We have actually noticed some improvements because the camera's launch, and will continue to evaluate and update this review, as needed.</p>

It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize people you have actually labeled (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our screening-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
