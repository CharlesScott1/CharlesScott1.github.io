<p>The implicit justification for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the hazard of terrorist attacks. However suicide opponents are plainly not prevented by camera - and may even be drawn in to the tv coverage cameras can ensure - and the expenditure of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far goes beyond the minimal advantages that the system might supply in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>We inform residential and non-residential alarm system owners, operators and users about the alarm authorization requirement and false alarm prevention procedures.
