<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you walk by.
