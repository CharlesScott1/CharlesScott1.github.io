<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
