<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also great metal construction.

Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that.
