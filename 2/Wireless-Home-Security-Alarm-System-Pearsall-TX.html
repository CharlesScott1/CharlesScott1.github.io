<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and an incredible worth. It gets an Excellent rating for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription prepare for additional cloud storage. But the company does use a Total Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is found. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is an enjoyment to use as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's great, though.

It also makes your camera more tamper-proof due to the fact that it does not have wires that can be cut. Unfortunately I bought 4 cameras that look just like these, believing I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Kid was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is really great. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
