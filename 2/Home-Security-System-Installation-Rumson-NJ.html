<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
