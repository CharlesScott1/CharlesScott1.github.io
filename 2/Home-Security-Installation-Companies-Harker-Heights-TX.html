This design also includes a clever app that lets you see through the eyes of your cameras and quickly record at any time.

<p>As formerly pointed out, the economical video surveillance services, like any electronic device, have longevity in milder climates and climate-controlled environments. It's when installed outdoors in harsher climates that they fail to perform regularly. Expert video surveillance cameras, whether analog or digital, offer ruggedized outdoor enclosures or housings particularly developed to safeguard the camera from the elements and the imagery created by those cameras. These housings consist of heating systems, not just to keep the equipment warm in subzero temperatures, but also to prevent the dome or window from fogging up in damp and cool weather.</p>

A lot of clever cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives much easier and Hive's ecosystem measures up to that. It's all the function without any aggravation.</p>
