The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of free cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly cost ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to properly detect motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop.
