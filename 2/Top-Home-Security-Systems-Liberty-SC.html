The first guard arrived early so he might look at the entire area and speak with me about my concerns. He was expert, extremely encouraging and considerate. The 2nd guard got here in the middle of the night and took over. When I arrived in the morning to get the event started, he was also expert, reassuring and courteous. We were really pleased with your service and I will suggest that we contact your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. I didn't fret when after leaving our property in your hands.</p>
