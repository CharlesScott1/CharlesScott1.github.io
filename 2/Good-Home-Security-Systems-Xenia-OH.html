The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
