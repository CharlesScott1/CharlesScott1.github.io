<h3>Home Security System Service in North Carolina</h3>
<p>Because it's more complicated than it needs to be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and combination all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

IP cameras boast sharper, higher resolution images and more versatile functions like remote zoom and repositioning. They also offer you the alternative to see footage on a web browser.
