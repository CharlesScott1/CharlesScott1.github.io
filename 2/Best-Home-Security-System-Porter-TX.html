Still, if technology has made us vulnerable, then it can also make us secure. Tech companies have actually been pressing hard to innovate in the connected home CCTV camera space.

More recently, decentralized IP cameras, perhaps equipped with megapixel sensing units, assistance recording directly to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for entirely stand-alone operation.</p>
<p>4G Wireless works similar to a mobile phone. The modem links to the web just like a cell phone. One of the things to consider with this alternative is not only is a sim card required but also a cellular modem and a switch would need to be encased in an enclosure if the camera is put outside, this is presuming there is a neighboring power supply if not a solar panel would be needed. Also bear in mind there would be a regular monthly fee for utilizing a 4G network comparable to internet, if you don't pay the bill the cameras would have no signal. This is not a good alternative for homes or business' in the nation where cell phone service is restricted.</p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

We agree with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capacity is a bit minimal to suggest as a top pick.</p>
