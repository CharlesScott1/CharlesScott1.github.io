<p>Thanks to recent advancements in innovation, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've decided to install an alarm system, you should consider the following advantages of wireless technology. The $260 Fundamentals plan consists of the base station, a keypad, four entry sensing units, one motion sensor, a yard sign, and 2 window decals. For $15 per month, you can include 24/7 expert monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline.
