Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".
