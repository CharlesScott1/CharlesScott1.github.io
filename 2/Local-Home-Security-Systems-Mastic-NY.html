<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
