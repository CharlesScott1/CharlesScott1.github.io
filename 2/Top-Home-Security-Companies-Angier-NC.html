<p>Nurse calling systems usually consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's bathroom. He can press the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station if a client is having trouble. This is a simple switch that is usually open or normally closed. Most of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and notifies, sensing units, access control, and so on. My mind conceptualized an approach of not just supplying the client with the patient-monitoring system but incorporating it into their antiquated nurse call station system.</p>
<p>Analog high definition cameras are a great choice for organisations to update from analog CCTV that has already been wired using coax cable or CAT-5 cable. AHD cameras use the very same RG59 or RG6 cable as standard CCTV cameras. CAT-5 cable with video baluns can likewise be used. While pro monitoring costs more, it's more secure.
