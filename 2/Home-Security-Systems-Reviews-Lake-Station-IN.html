ADT's higher-tier plans do cost more than many other alarm companies-- plus they need a $99 installation fee-- but if you need a lot of control over the comings and goings of your business, it's most likely worth it. And considering that ADT uses exact same- and next-day installation, you can get that additional security in no time, which looks like good value.</p>
