<p>There's no time to waste if you do not have appropriate security or fire protection for your business. A burglary or fire might happen at any time, and you do not wish to be surprised-- particularly when Wayne Alarm has an easy, inexpensive service. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

Frontpoint's detectors are unsusceptible to family pets weighing up to 40 pounds. With ADT, the professional installer can customize the sensitivity level based on your family pet's size.</p>
