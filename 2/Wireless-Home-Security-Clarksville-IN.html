<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is certainly something to be taken into account. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal.
