Adding an exterior video camera gives you a lot more control over your home's security.

<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most cost-effective monitoring plan starting at $10. You can get all the fundamentals like e-mail, push, and SMS signals, along with 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's most inexpensive, Always On" plan. However, you will need to pay for extra $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) each month, and this doesn't included professional monitoring.
