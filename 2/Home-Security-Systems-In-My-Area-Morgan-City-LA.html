When citizens are being viewed by the authorities - or conscious they may be seen at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being seen by armed government agents tends to deter things. You don't want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "individuals might learn to be mindful about the books and regulars they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, drug addicts or members."
