Throughout testing, we found it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly activating when movement was identified. We enjoy that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For the majority of homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get expensive.
