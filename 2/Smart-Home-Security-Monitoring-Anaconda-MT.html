<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>

<p>The genuine reason cameras are normally deployed is to decrease much pettier criminal activities. However it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been extensively deployed in public places, sociologists studying the issue have actually discovered that they have not reduced criminal activity. "Once the criminal offense and offense figures were adapted to take account of the general down pattern in offences and criminal offenses," criminologists discovered in one research study, "reductions were kept in mind in specific categories however there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had minimized crime in general in the city centre."

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
