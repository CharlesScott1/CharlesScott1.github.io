The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually installed on the porch by a licensed electrician (who occurs to be my hubby).

Nevertheless, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Likewise, the Blink does not provide you geofencing or two-way interaction, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas.
