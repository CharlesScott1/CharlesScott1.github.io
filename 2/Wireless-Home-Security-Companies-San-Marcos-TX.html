<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's stats given that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest offender for brief battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capacity is a bit minimal to suggest as a top choice.</p>
<p>Aside from good Wi-Fi, you may also require a close-by outlet. Many cameras need an Air Conditioner connection, which means you will not have the ability to position them simply anywhere. Numerous of the cameras we evaluated offered the option to use battery power, but we have yet to discover the perfect one. The models we have actually examined so far either record really brief clips, leave giant spaces in between those short clips, or need charging on a regular basis.</p>
