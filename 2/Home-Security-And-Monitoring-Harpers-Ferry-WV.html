This likewise depends upon the provider, but you can expect signing a contract with companies who require professional installation of their systems. The average length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some agreements could cover as much as 60 months or 5 years.

In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
