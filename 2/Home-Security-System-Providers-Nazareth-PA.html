<p>This is the best-scoring smart alarm we tested. It was exceptionally basic to set up, as the parts are pre-paired to the base station, and it fasted to activate when any of the sensing units were activated. We love that it features both internal and external sirens and will even work with Philips Shade clever lights, too. The instructions are incredibly extensive and the 200m range of the alarm means it can be used to protect garages and sheds along with your home. The alarm system does not include a wifi security camera but you can buy a number of various Yale cameras that will deal with the alarm as optional additionals.
