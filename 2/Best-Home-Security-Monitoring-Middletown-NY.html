This is also known as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance strategy, which argues that opportunities to offend can be reduced by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a culprit being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the criminal activity, decreasing rewards from criminal activity commission, and minimizing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This means that the transgressor needs to be aware of the added surveillance for it to attain its preferred result.</p>

Its double articulating LED floodlights cover a really wide area, and you can dim them via its app if you want mood lighting on your deck or patio area for a party. Additionally they can not transmit fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution bits of video.

If you do buy them, initially check the suppliers return policy and second keep the receipt.</p>
