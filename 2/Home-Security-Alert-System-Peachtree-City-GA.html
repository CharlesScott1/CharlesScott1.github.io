<p>Viewing angle: The camera's field of vision determines how much it can see. As you're most likely monitoring a single space, you desire a wide viewing angle.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
