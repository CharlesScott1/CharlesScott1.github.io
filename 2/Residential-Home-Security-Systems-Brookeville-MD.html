Nevertheless, people need to consider the frequency and period of their absences from home or business - rather than simply their tenancy. Who is home, when they are not? Who will hear and react to the alarm? And so on. Less than half the protection the client expects is being offered if that system is not monitored.</p>
<p>A self-monitored home security system relies on the homeowner to view their home and contact cops in the event of an emergency. A self-monitored system does not mean a property owner has to compromise any features. Property owners can tailor the system to their needs and can decide to have the unit professionally installed or do it themselves. Unlike other monitoring alternatives, self-monitored systems do not have a monthly monitoring charge.</p>
