<p>We love the benefit and versatility of wireless home security cameras. Among our favorites, the Arlo Pro 3, is 100% wire-free. Its Wi-Fi connection and battery make it easy to install practically anywhere a ladder can reach. Doorbell cameras have ended up being a popular security tool.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
