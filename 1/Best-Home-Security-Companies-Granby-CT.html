<p>We love the benefit and versatility of wireless home security cameras. Among our favorites, the Arlo Pro 3, is 100% wire-free. Its Wi-Fi connection and battery make it easy to install practically anywhere a ladder can reach. Doorbell cameras have ended up being a popular security tool.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
