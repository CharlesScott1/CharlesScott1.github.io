<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Call for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small charge. We advise the eight-piece kit since it features multiple door and window sensors for complete coverage. We likewise recommend including a doorbell camera eventually. The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be costly. Consider the upfront cost of the control board, activation fees, monitoring charges and all equipment.
