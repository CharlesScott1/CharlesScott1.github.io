Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
