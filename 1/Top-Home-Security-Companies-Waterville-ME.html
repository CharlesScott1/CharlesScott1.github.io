<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
<h3>Home Alarm Systems Wireless Waterville ME 04901</h3>
<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of straight plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you need additional cable televisions.
