Here's a look at Vivint security cameras for indoor and outdoor surveillance. Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later on. The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features.
