<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
