<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much larger location and therefore provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
