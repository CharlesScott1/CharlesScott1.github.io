As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers understand that the affordable customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
