<p>We still believe the Ring Alarm is a great option for a cheap home security system with wise home support. But maybe avoid the cameras for now. Hard disk storage is safe, secure, and practical, with many systems providing expansion and complimentary cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera shop to an SD card, which you'll need to manually remove to transfer the data? Does it go to your smart device, or upload to services like Dropbox?
