<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>

In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
