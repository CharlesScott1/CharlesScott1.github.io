In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a private security guard. A number of cities also need a license to even own and operate a home security system. Guidelines such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
