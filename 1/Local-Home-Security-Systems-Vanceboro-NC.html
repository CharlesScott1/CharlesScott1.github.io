<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve detail after the fact, which means that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays.
