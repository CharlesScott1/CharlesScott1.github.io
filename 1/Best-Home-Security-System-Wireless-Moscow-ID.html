(The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However since most retail theft would not trip an alarm anyway (a worker slipping some additional cash while offering a customer modification, for example), we believe it's more important to have top quality images so you have the evidence you need. Which's what Nest provides you.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
