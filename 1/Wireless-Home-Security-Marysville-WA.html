Given that no keys exchange hands, you have more control over your front door. Plus, you can alter or get rid of the gain access to code at any time.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
