<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics given that this originates from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant culprit for brief battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capability is a bit minimal to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>You can choose from SimpliSafe's original award-winning system or their latest line of equipment. Both systems use outstanding, trustworthy home security. With the more recent system, you will pay more, but that greater price includes a system that is smaller, much faster, and more powerful. At half the size of the original system, the small sensing units are practically unnoticeable. The new system works 5 times quicker, and the alarm is 50% louder to frighten intruders.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
