<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm, a variety of companies offer "free monitoring services" for the very first couple of months. Many insurance companies provide discounts on insurance coverage premiums to consumers with operable alarm. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous police departments provide several "totally free" false alarms before imposing any fine, even though the cost to respond is substantial right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurers call into question the appropriateness of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of permitting 3 or four free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, because they provide no up-front rewards to motivate owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
