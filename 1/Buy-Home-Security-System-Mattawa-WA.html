Some people might say that we must not have surveillance cameras in public locations. They declare that they get into privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you desire personal privacy? Surveillance cameras are meant to keep you and other residential or commercial property safe, not to stalk you.

However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they respond at all.

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you walk by.
