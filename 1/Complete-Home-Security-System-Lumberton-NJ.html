<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve.

Typically, the simple presence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated trespassers. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more figured out burglars. They may also be less cautious about covering their faces and their tracks if trespassers can not see any security cameras.</p>
