Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
