<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into account. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.
