<p>Our alarm systems might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an infraction.

Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
