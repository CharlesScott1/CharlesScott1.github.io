These surveillance cameras are classified as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the type of camera used by these big box chains to secure their inventory. Look at the ceiling of consumer electronics shops and warehouse chains and you will discover in each aisle a white dome camera that is bigger than the average consumer camera. Let that sink in for a minute ... these companies do not even use the kind of cameras they are offering to the general public, and there is a good reason.</p>

For low maintenance, Frontpoint equipment is powered by long-lasting batteries. For instance, batteries in their pet-friendly motion sensing units will serve for about seven years.

<p>We like that the Argus 2 features a color night vision alternative, however the black and white version can really be clearer and provide you higher-quality footage.

We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
