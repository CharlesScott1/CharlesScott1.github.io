<p>This awesome clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During screening, we discovered it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly triggering when motion was discovered. We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your home, which can get expensive. It's also worth noting that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it just keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
