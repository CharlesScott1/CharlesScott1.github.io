<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>

Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a particular area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011).
