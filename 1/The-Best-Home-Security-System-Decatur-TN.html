<p>Because it's more complicated than it ought to be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
