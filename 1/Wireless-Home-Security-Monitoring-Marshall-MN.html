<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the picture quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day.

<p>Just bought a bullet ip system and definitely like it. Terrific clarity. I wanted to set up viewing on my cell phone but had a couple concerns that the tech answered with ease. I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what offers the video history and smarter signals, for instance.
