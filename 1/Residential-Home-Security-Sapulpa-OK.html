Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi information. (You must play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pets shout, cats scream, children cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
