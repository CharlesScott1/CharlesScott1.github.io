<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the specific very same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm.
