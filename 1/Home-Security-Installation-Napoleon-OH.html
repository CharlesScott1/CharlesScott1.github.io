Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial.
