<p>In plants, CCTV equipment may be used to observe parts of a process from a central control space, for instance when the environment is not ideal for human beings. CCTV systems might operate continually or just as required to monitor a particular occasion. A more advanced form of CCTV, making use of digital video recorders (DVRs), supplies recording for potentially many years, with a variety of quality and performance choices and additional features (such as motion detection and e-mail signals). More recently, decentralized IP cameras, possibly geared up with megapixel sensing units, support recording straight to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for entirely stand-alone operation.</p>
<p>Wide-angle lens: A larger lens lets you see more of what remains in front of the camera, left to right-- you don't want a narrow peek at the space. The typical field of vision is 130 degrees.
