Their low cost is among the reasons that they have actually ended up being so popular over the past a number of years.</p>
<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server operated by the manufacturer, instead of at your house) is the standard these days, but some cameras store recordings locally on a microSD card or a linked hard drive. Onboard storage is nice, however it will not be of much aid if someone takes the camera. Hackers can acquire control of wireless camera systems.
