This lets operators focus on particular locations or track specific motions. The cameras can also run patterns or turn to a predetermined position.</p>
<p>Unless cut or otherwise harmed, hardwired security systems stay linked no matter what, since wires are connected to sensors that don't require batteries to run, getting rid of the possibility that a wired system might stop working due to an ill-timed battery blackout.
