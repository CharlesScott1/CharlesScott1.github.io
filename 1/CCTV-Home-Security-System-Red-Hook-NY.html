<p>When they detect any type of activity, a lot of security cameras simply send you a notification. Others can identify who-- or what-- is triggering the turmoil. The Nest Cam IQ offers face-recognition technology, for example.

<p>The Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro is developed to provide HD video with a 4K HDR sensor and a large range of vision with a 140-degree field of vision.

<p>As soon as all linked together, if someone opens a window or door, or walks past a sensing unit, you will get an alert on your phone.

Some systems can then sound an alarm or contact the emergency situation services, and many also allow you to talk through the camera. The latter is perfect if you're stating hi to the kids who've simply got back from school, or for yelling at the pet dog to leave the couch.</p>
<p>Analogue signals can also be transformed into a digital signal to enable the recordings to be stored on a PC as digital recordings In that case the analogue camera must be plugged straight into a video capture card in the computer system, and the card then transforms the analogue signal to digital. These cards are relatively cheap, but undoubtedly the resulting digital signals are compressed 5:1 (MPEG compression) in order for the video recordings to be saved money on a continuous basis.</p>
