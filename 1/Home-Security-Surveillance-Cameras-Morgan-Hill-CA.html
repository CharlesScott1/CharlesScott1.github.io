<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
