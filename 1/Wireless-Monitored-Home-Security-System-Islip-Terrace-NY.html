Look for a model that uses a high resolution (1080p), a broad angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range as much as 25 feet, and cost effective cloud storage for tape-recorded video. Sometimes it's practical to be able to see what took place just before or after a visitor approaches your door.
