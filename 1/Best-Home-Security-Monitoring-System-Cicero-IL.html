<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus scams, theft, and vandalism. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must once again react to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of expensive incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a specific level, you can make it instantly turn off the heater. If the motion sensing units are set off, you can automatically make the smart lights turn on to scare away potential robbers.</p>
