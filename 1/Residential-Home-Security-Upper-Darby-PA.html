<p>Burglar alarms have actually become standard equipment in shops and other organisations, and they're ending up being significantly common in private homes too.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
