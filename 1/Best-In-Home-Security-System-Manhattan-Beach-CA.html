Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the cops if they take place regularly enough.

Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
