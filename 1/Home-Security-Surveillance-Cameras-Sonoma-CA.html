<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later produced to address the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those file encryption plans, any customer in the network that knows the keys can read all the traffic.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
