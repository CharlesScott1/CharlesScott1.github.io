The latter allows you to see specifically when a particular individual comes to your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has expanded its security variety with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units called Tags (₤ 89.99).
