<p>Reliability is a highly subjective when it comes to technology matter, depending on which features and advantages a private favors. Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, however low signal strength and poor connection are still common complaints.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
