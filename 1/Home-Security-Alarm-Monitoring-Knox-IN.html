<p>On the surface, these two camera classifications might appear comparable, though if you had the ability to see within, the differences become obvious and unique. Commercial-grade cameras are created and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not an alternative; consumer-grade cameras are not. Generally, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is plenty of available light, and as soon as the lighting becomes absent or low (think sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
