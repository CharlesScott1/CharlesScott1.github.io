<p>We enjoy that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision choice, but the white and black version can really be clearer and give you higher-quality video.

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical considering that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers recognize that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
