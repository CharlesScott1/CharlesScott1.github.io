<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions.
