<h3>Home Alarm Monitoring Services Fillmore CA 93015</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's statistics because this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant offender for brief battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capacity is a bit limited to advise as a top pick.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a knowing curve.
