It's a simple to utilize camera with a bevy of adjustable controls. It runs on a rechargeable battery, and has a weatherproof case that protects it from the elements.</p>

<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
