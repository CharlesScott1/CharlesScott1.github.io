<p>Three big advantages of wireless security systems for renters are their impermanence, mobility and expandability. Renters, unlike property owners, generally avoid making permanent modifications to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other elements can easily be established at different properties later on, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new elements too.
