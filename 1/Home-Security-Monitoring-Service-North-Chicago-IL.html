<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Need to be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
