<p>Cameras with built in wifi that communicate with existing network needs a recognized wifi connection. One of the things to bear in mind with this alternative is the range from the camera to the wifi connection. Long range placement might need extra equipment such as wireless radio.

These cameras record everybody similarly: the general public setting about their everyday activities, and bad guys who likely protect or mix themselves in to avoid being tape-recorded or found.
