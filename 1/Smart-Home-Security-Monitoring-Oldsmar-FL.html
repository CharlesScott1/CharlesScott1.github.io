Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to save and for how long you prepare to keep recorded video footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>
