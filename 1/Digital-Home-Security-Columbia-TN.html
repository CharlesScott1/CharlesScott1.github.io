<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Since this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to by hand stop notifications (and recording, because it does that even when alerts are off). We likewise experienced above-average connection problems, with 2 Hive test systems detaching 8 times over 2 months. Scout is really easy to utilize, specifically if you're a fan of mobile phones.
