In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

"As soon as the criminal offense and offence figures were adjusted to appraise the basic down trend in criminal offenses and offenses," criminologists discovered in one study, "decreases were kept in mind in specific categories but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had actually decreased criminal offense in general in the city centre."
