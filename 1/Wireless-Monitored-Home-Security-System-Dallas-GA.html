<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides complimentary perks like person detection, familiar-face notifies, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 each month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face informs worked just about 50 percent of the time and the camera routinely disconnected from the network multiple times a day (when whatever else on our network appeared fine).
