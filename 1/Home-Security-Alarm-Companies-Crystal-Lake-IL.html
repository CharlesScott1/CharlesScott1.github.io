<p>Nurse calling systems normally consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's toilet. If a client is having trouble, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station. This is a basic switch that is typically open or normally closed.

<p>Analog high definition cameras are a terrific alternative for services to upgrade from analog CCTV that has already been wired utilizing coax cable television or CAT-5 cable television.

Seems like a safer bet to us.</p>
