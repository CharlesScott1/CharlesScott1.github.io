<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record approximately 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were often missing, despite showing up in the app's activity timeline. With basic clever home devices like automated door locks, you can remain in bed and examine that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you look out for potential package thieves or speak to visitors who drop in.</p>
