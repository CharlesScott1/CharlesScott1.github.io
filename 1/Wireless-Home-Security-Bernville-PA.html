After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly 6 months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to deliver on its pledge of up to one year of battery life.

<h3>House Alarm System With Cameras Bernville PA 19506</h3>

However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Likewise, the Blink doesn't offer you geofencing or two-way interaction, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.
