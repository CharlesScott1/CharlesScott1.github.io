In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
