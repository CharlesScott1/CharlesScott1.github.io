<h3>Cheap Home Security in South Carolina</h3>
<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complicated than it ought to be. Recordings, signals, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
