Low battery or irregular power source. Lots of wireless systems run on batteries which, if not altered often, can trigger an incorrect alarm. Regular power failures or alter in voltage can also set off false alarms by harming the system and its sensing units.</p>
<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be thought about. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is a terrific choice for long range circumstances where poles and trees are not present.</p>

Both the original Abode system and the Abode Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only design we checked that likewise works with HomeKit. We've experienced a few technical concerns while long-term screening the Residence Iota, therefore will continue to test and upgrade appropriately. We no longer suggest it.</p>
