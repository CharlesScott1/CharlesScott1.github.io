<p>Twenty-five years back, basic and business communications were primarily synchronous. To achieve nearly anything, someone live" required to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, especially when dealing with nationwide and global business. The same holds true for security and video surveillance. Usually, CCTV is most effective as an active system, with a security guard monitoring the corridors and somebody else, somewhere, viewing video surveillance displays for support. Everything is integrated and everything happens in genuine time.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
