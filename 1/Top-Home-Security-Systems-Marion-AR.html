<p>Discover how to create, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and decrease criminal activity. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with horrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our system was malfunctioning, therefore we might review this review. Essentially, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of footage to the cloud. The wide face of the camera offers you a remarkable visual field, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the much better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.)
