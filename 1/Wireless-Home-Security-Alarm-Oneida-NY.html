DVR systems are difficult to scale up due to the fact that as soon as every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you require to buy a completely new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs also require that the linked cameras remain in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to break down.</p>
