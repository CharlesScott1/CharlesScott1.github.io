Alarm monitoring is not just an economical method to secure your home or business from break-in, medical and fire emergency situations, but it might spend for itself! Lots of insurer provide premium discounts to professionally monitored alarm customers - in some cases up to 20% off. Across 76 studies, Piza and associates (2019) found that closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance had a statistically significant impact on general criminal activity (OR = 1.14). This indicates that the odds of general crime happening in the treatment locations with CCTV were reduced by 14 percent compared to the control areas that had no surveillance.</p>

Hiding a camera within a frame, clock, sprinkler head, or smoke alarm might make a reception security camera more effective, but make certain to consult state laws regarding the legality of a concealed camera before doing so.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
