<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a fantastic security camera and a remarkable worth. It gets an Outstanding ranking for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage. However the company does provide a Total Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is found. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to utilize also (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's fantastic, though. If you don't already have an Arlo camera or more in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can mean there are variety concerns.</p>
