<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally described as shock sensors, are various because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Usually, the most intense frequencies created are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
