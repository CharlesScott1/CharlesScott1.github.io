<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the responsibility of the entire neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to save and for how long you prepare to keep taped footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to consume storage area quickly.
