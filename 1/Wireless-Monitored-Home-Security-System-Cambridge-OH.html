<p>Amongst IP security choices, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the footage from anywhere. A common misunderstanding is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cord. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder straight which then connects to the web and a router. Finally, wire-free cameras are completely cable complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the easiest alternative to install and all of the tape-recorded video is kept in the cloud.</p>
