<p>B. This chapter governs alarm system systems meant to summon police department personnel, needs registration, evaluation of costs for extreme incorrect burglar alarms, offers procedures for repeat wrongdoers, and supplies a reliable date. While some vestiges of the old market stay, today's property owners exist with a lot more choices.
