If you purchased cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable television (look at the cable behind the TV that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that means you have traditional analog CCTV security cameras. You can update your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax facilities if you buy HD-CCTV security system. That's simply $0.63 a day (or about $19 a month) for the House Iota All-in-One security camera, an extra contact sensor, and a remote crucial fob.

Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera as well as a separate source of power, meaning a more complex setup and more wires.
