For example, a public transit rider may observe someone acting suspiciously. Many people are fiddling, texting or surfing with their mobile phones. With ELERTS, a user can discretely snap a picture of the suspicious activity and send it to security officials with a few clicks. Reports from cellphone users can be quickly examined and acted upon by Public Safety authorities.</p>

<p>ADT licensed provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, but the brand doesn't otherwise charge up front for a system it states deserves $1,300. The equipment's all supplied by 3rd parties, so what you receive might be from a different maker than the equipment your neighbor received. Why's that? ADT uses an independent distributor model involving third-party dealerships. The dealers figure out which equipment to use. Costs for systems vary.

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
