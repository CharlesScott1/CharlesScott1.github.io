<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, dealing with innovative clever home enthusiasts or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, including smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. However the Secure is pricey, additional sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include fire alarms or camera backups-- is also costly if you don't commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>Analog high definition cameras are a terrific option for businesses to update from analog CCTV that has actually currently been wired utilizing coax cable television or CAT-5 cable.

Looks like a safer bet to us.</p>
<p>The second wireless function relates to how your security system interacts with the alarm monitoring station. Older security systems would use a home phone line to dial out" and communicate with the alarm monitoring station. However, many households no longer utilize a phone line in their home.
