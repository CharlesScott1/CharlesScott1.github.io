<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm system, a variety of companies provide "totally free monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Many insurance companies provide discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many cops departments use a number of "complimentary" false alarms prior to enforcing any fine, although the cost to respond is considerable right from the start. The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies call into question the appropriateness of the present pattern in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or 4 complimentary incorrect alarms per calendar year, because they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
